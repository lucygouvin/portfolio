        My passion for software began when I graduated with a B.A. in Digital
        Art from Smith College. Now, I’m a Full Stack Web Developer who loves
        creating simple, intuitive applications. In my previous professional
        life, I was a video game Project Manager leading teams ranging from ten
        to fifty people. I’m known among my teams for my ability to see how all
        the moving pieces come together to create a finished product. My
        experience as an Agile leader has made me into the adaptable,
        collaborative, thoughtful developer that I am today.
